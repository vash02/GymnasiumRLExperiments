# Run Instructions

This assignment consists of several Python files implementing different functions for reinforcement learning tasks. Below are the details of each task and the associated files.

## Main Execution File
`main.py`

### Instructions:
- The `main.py` file contains functions for running computations and generating results for each task.
- The calls to these functions are at the end of the file and are commented out.
- Uncomment one or all statements based on the task you want to execute.
- Run `main.py` to obtain the results for the chosen task(s).

## Function Calls:
- `valIterDemo()`: Demonstrates Value Iteration
- `policyIterDemo()`: Demonstrates Policy Iteration
- `modPolicyIterDemo()`: Demonstrates Modified Policy Iteration
- `modelBasedRLDemo()`: Demonstrates noise introduced transition function Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
- `naiveModelBasedRLDemo()`: Demonstrates Naive Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
